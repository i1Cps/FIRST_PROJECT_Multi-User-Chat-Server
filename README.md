Download the java filed from the "code". To start our server first run the "ChatServer" class. This class
has a default IP Address "localhost" and defualt port number "14002". The ChatServer class has optional
args if you want to change the port number. To do this add "-csp "number"" in the terminal
when you call the ChatServer class.

"localhost" and default port number "14002". To connect to a different IP Address or port number use the 
optional args "-cca + IP Address" if you want to connect to a different IP Address or "-ccp + port number"
